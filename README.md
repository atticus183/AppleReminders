<br>I decided to reverse engineer the Apple's Reminders app for a portfolio project.  

### Features
<br>- 100% programmatic, no storyboard
<br>- Realm Mobile Database for local storage
<br>- Swift Package Manager to manage Realm and SwiftDate
<br>- UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource and UITableViewDiffableDataSource
<br>- Contacts framework to allow users to select from their contacts to assign to a reminder
<br>- Developed a custom approach to reuse the view controller to view Today, Scheduled, All, Flagged, by List, and Searching reminders
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Features not implemented
<br>- Saving images to reminders
<br>- Sharing reminder lists with other users
<br>- Push notifications
